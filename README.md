This is an example project using Magic Leap UE4 Editor UE4. It features a radial menu that attaches to the Magic Leap One motion controller. UE4 v.4.22.0-0+release-sdk-0.21.0-ee82cab 

Currently nothing is commented and its still rough but it functions. If you have any questions feel free to contact me on discord : https://discord.gg/wmXevff
