# ML_RadialMenu
___
This is an example project using Magic Leap UE4 Editor UE4. It features a radial menu that attaches to the Magic Leap One motion controller. UE4 v.4.22.0-0+release-sdk-0.21.0-ee82cab 

Currently nothing is commented and its still rough but it functions. If you have any questions feel free to contact me on discord : https://discord.gg/wmXevff

Please give me feedback, I'd love to hear what you have to say.

### Updates Touch Location
I noticed it was hard to tell where my thumb was when moving to the next item. Adding a glowing dot to the material shader provides users with visual feedback; minimising failed activations.
